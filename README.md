### About this file

#### Description:

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenge against its detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous). After using some pre-processing techniques on the data set, the analysis of classification is used to predict whether the tumor cells are malignant or not using SVM (Radial basis Function).
